# Introduction

APISpark Data Stores can wrap external data sources so that you can leverage the data they contain by means of the APISpark platform.

These special Data Stores are called **Wrappers**.

APISpark supports a number of external data sources for both Entity Stores (structured data) and File Stores (static files).

To create a **Wrapper** Entity Store, go to your **Dashboard** and click on the **+ Entity Store** button.

Select the type of external data source you would like to wrap from the **Type** drop-down menu.

Each wrapper has its own simple configuration procedure.
